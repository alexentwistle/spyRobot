## Monitor your competitor's robots.txt files for changes

Robots.txt files are often used to prevent search engine crawling of upcoming features. 

Monitoring robots.txt files can give you an early insight into these new features, or help you to understand other changes to your competitor's sites. 

You can also monitor your own robots.txt file to get informed of any accidental changes.

## How it works (currently)

1. Enter the domains you'd like to monitor
2. spyRobot will fetch all their robots.txt files whenever you request
3. spyRobot will store and display the latest versions of the files
4. spyRobot will let you know what, if anything, has changed
